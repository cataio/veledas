      At Veleda Security, we believe in a personalized, hands-on approach to cybersecurity.
      Our team is distributed across the United States, with primary offices in Romania
      and US, yet we support organizations on a global scale. We engineer solutions
      that match your unique environment and risk profile. Whether it's maturing
      application security or configuring end-to-end visibility, our aim is to help
      organizations adopt the best technical and governance practices.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Veleda Security started with the idea that every organization has unique challenges.
        We tailor everything: from code-to-cloud security, to real-world threat scenarios,
        to stakeholder alignment and continuous training. Our engineers, architects, and
        analysts focus on delivering measurable value, not just handing over documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also design governance programs to ensure that security tools and methods
        stay relevant over time. Our methodology emphasizes developer enablement,
        leadership engagement, and tangible results. We’ve helped clients integrate
        SAST, SCA, and secrets detection tools into CI/CD
        pipelines, and we've guided them in adopting frameworks such as NIST SSDF
        and OWASP best practices.

      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <p><strong>Custom Cybersecurity Engineering:</strong> We design solutions from the
        ground up, using modern frameworks and proven security paradigms to align with
        your operational environment and business objectives.</p>

      <p><strong>AppSec Program Design & Implementation:</strong> We help integrate
        SAST/SCA tools like Snyk into developer workflows, perform secrets scanning
        with Trufflehog, and set up processes to reduce false positives. Our focus
        is on enabling teams to adopt secure practices without disrupting delivery.</p>

      <p><strong>Real-Time Threat Detection & Incident Response:</strong> We offer
        advanced analytics, from code security to runtime analysis in containerized
        environments. We correlate vulnerabilities with actual usage, so teams can
        tackle the highest-risk issues first.</p>

      <p><strong>Governance & Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> We guide clients in
        establishing champion programs, governance policies, and measurement systems
        that ensure security insights reach both developers and senior leadership.
        This includes mapping to compliance standards and frameworks.</p>

      <p><strong>Identity & Access Management:</strong> We run audits to ensure continuous, least-privilege
        access across the organization.</p>

      <p><strong>24/7 SOC & Monitoring:</strong> Our Security Operations approach
        gives you around-the-clock coverage to detect and respond to incidents.
        We help unify logs, alerts, and reporting to keep you ahead of potential
        intrusions.</p>

      <h2>SIEM Transformation & Optimization</h2>
      <p>
        We help organizations modernize their Security Information and Event Management
        capabilities. Our approach focuses on reducing log noise, migrating from legacy
        platforms to cutting-edge tools, and aligning SIEM data to real-time,
        high-fidelity threat detection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also design and implement SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
        workflows that streamline your response process. Our goal is to create a robust,
        scalable monitoring and incident response ecosystem where every alert is meaningful
        and every incident is swiftly contained.

  <h2>Cloud Security</h2>
  <p>
    At Veleda Security, we treat your cloud environment as a strategic asset. We align
    identity, networking, encryption, monitoring, and vulnerability management into
    a framework that reflects well-known standards. Our goal is a secure, flexible,
    and auditable foundation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We start by capturing your administrative policies. These might include “encrypt
    all data at rest” or “restrict public network access.” We then transform them into
    real guardrails through policy enforcement layers. Your vision becomes tangible,
    automated controls.
  </p>
  <p>
    We enforce these rules at build-time through infrastructure-as-code scanning. If
    a pipeline tries to deploy a public IP or skip encryption, it gets flagged and
    halted immediately. This early interception prevents high-risk misconfigurations.
  </p>
  <p>
    At run-time, we augment built-in policy enforcement with external posture management
    tools. This approach monitors your cloud for any drift from your standards. If the
    environment deviates, we detect and alert in real time, preserving consistency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our guardrails ensure continuous compliance. They enforce region usage, encryption
    key requirements, and no-public-IP rules. If a service or tool lacks certain
    controls, we help you handle the risk or find an alternative. The standard never
    drops.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hold a zero trust stance for all cloud integrations. If a partner or third-party
    solution cannot meet multi-factor authentication or encryption mandates, we work
    with you to decide on the best path forward. Security must be uniform across the
    entire ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    We integrate logs and telemetry into your preferred analytics platform, so your SOC
    can correlate events and detect anomalies. We also layer in automated scanning
    features for immediate insights. Our aim is clarity, not clutter.
  </p>
  <p>
    We define roles and responsibilities from day one. Architecture teams set standards.
    Security engineers implement policies. The SOC monitors, responds, and fine-tunes
    defenses. This synergy keeps processes realistic and effective.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our architecture evolves as your cloud environment does. Whenever a new service or
    feature arises, we validate it against encryption, logging, and posture management
    expectations. We incorporate it only if it meets your established baseline.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also provide runtime security and container protection. Our advanced posture
    management approach covers serverless and traditional workloads alike. In this
    way, you maintain end-to-end visibility as you scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Veleda Security, you get a boutique partner who understands the intricacies
    of cloud security. We fuse best practices, continuous compliance, and operational
    ease so you can focus on growth—knowing your foundation is secure.
