    <p>
      At Veleda Security, we believe in a personalized, hands-on approach to cybersecurity.
      Our team is distributed across the United States, with primary offices in New York
      and Boston, yet we support organizations on a global scale. We engineer solutions
      that match your unique environment and risk profile. Whether it's maturing
      application security or configuring end-to-end visibility, our aim is to help
      organizations adopt the best technical and governance practices.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Veleda Security started with the idea that every organization has unique challenges.
        We tailor everything: from code-to-cloud security, to real-world threat scenarios,
        to stakeholder alignment and continuous training. Our engineers, architects, and
        analysts focus on delivering measurable value, not just handing over documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also design governance programs to ensure that security tools and methods
        stay relevant over time. Our methodology emphasizes developer enablement,
        leadership engagement, and tangible results. We’ve helped clients integrate
        SAST, SCA, and secrets detection tools (like Snyk and Trufflehog) into CI/CD
        pipelines, and we've guided them in adopting frameworks such as NIST SSDF
        and OWASP best practices.

      <h2>Our Services</h2>
      <p><strong>Custom Cybersecurity Engineering:</strong> We design solutions from the
        ground up, using modern frameworks and proven security paradigms to align with
        your operational environment and business objectives.</p>

      <p><strong>AppSec Program Design & Implementation:</strong> We help integrate
        SAST/SCA tools like Snyk into developer workflows, perform secrets scanning
        with Trufflehog, and set up processes to reduce false positives. Our focus
        is on enabling teams to adopt secure practices without disrupting delivery.</p>

      <p><strong>Real-Time Threat Detection & Incident Response:</strong> We offer
        advanced analytics, from code security to runtime analysis in containerized
        environments. We correlate vulnerabilities with actual usage, so teams can
        tackle the highest-risk issues first.</p>

      <p><strong>Governance & Stakeholder Alignment:</strong> We guide clients in
        establishing champion programs, governance policies, and measurement systems
        that ensure security insights reach both developers and senior leadership.
        This includes mapping to compliance standards and frameworks.</p>

      <p><strong>Identity & Access Campaigns:</strong> We run certification campaigns
        using platforms like SailPoint IdentityNow to ensure continuous, least-privilege
        access across the organization.</p>

      <p><strong>24/7 SOC & Monitoring:</strong> Our Security Operations approach
        gives you around-the-clock coverage to detect and respond to incidents.
        We help unify logs, alerts, and reporting to keep you ahead of potential
        intrusions.</p>

    <section id="siem">
      <h2>SIEM Transformation & Optimization</h2>
      <p>
        We help organizations modernize their Security Information and Event Management
        capabilities. Our approach focuses on reducing log noise, migrating from legacy
        platforms to cutting-edge tools, and aligning SIEM data to real-time,
        high-fidelity threat detection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also design and implement SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
        workflows that streamline your response process. Our goal is to create a robust,
        scalable monitoring and incident response ecosystem where every alert is meaningful
        and every incident is swiftly contained.
